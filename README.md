- [There is zero gravity in outer space, so you would be weightless if you were floating out in space.](https://thefactbase.com/there-is-zero-gravity-in-outer-space-so-you-would-be-weightless-if-you-were-floating-out-in-space)
- [Crustaceans living in the deepest parts of the world's oceans contain toxic chemicals that were banned decades ago.](https://thefactbase.com/crustaceans-living-in-the-deepest-parts-of-the-world-s-oceans-contain-toxic-chemicals-that-were-banned-decades-ago)
- [Steel ships float because even though steel is denser than water, their hulls are full of air. They sink until enough water has been moved to match the weight of steel and air in the hull.](https://thefactbase.com/steel-ships-float-because-even-though-steel-is-denser-than-water-their-hulls-are-full-of-air-they-sink-until-enough-water-has-been-moved-to-match-the-weight-of-steel-and-air-in-the-hull)
- [If you spin a ball when you drop it, it will fly through the air as it falls. This is called the Magnus effect.](https://thefactbase.com/if-you-spin-a-ball-when-you-drop-it-it-will-fly-through-the-air-as-it-falls-this-is-called-the-magnus-effect)
- [There are two types of mass: inertial mass and gravitational mass.](https://thefactbase.com/there-are-two-types-of-mass-inertial-mass-and-gravitational-mass)
- [Electricity travels at the speed of light. That's more than 186,000 miles per second. A spark of static electricity can measure up to 3,000 volts.](https://thefactbase.com/electricity-travels-at-the-speed-of-light-that-s-more-than-186-000-miles-per-second-a-spark-of-static-electricity-can-measure-up-to-3-000-volts)
- [It takes a photon up to 40,000 years to travel from the core of the sun to its surface, but only 8 minutes to travel the rest of the way to Earth.](https://thefactbase.com/it-takes-a-photon-up-to-40-000-years-to-travel-from-the-core-of-the-sun-to-its-surface-but-only-8-minutes-to-travel-the-rest-of-the-way-to-earth)

- [When an electric charge builds up on the surface of an object it makes static electricity. You might have got a small electric shock, which is static electricity. This happens when an electric charge is quickly cancelled out by an opposite charge.](https://thefactbase.com/when-an-electric-charge-builds-up-on-the-surface-of-an-object-it-makes-static-electricity-you-might-have-got-a-small-electric-shock-which-is-static-electricity-this-happens-when-an-electric-charge-is-quickly-cancelled-out-by-an-opposite-charge)
- [What's the world's biggest source of energy? Well it actually comes from burning coal. Coal is burnt in furnaces which heats the water until it becomes steam. This then spins turbines which are attached to generators.](https://thefactbase.com/what-s-the-world-s-biggest-source-of-energy-well-it-actually-comes-from-burning-coal-coal-is-burnt-in-furnaces-which-heats-the-water-until-it-becomes-steam-this-then-spins-turbines-which-are-attached-to-generators)
- [In physics, weight is described as a force and can also be measured in Newtons. This unit of measurement is named for the scientist Isaac Newton, who is known for discovering gravity.](https://thefactbase.com/in-physics-weight-is-described-as-a-force-and-can-also-be-measured-in-newtons-this-unit-of-measurement-is-named-for-the-scientist-isaac-newton-who-is-known-for-discovering-gravity)
- [Ships float at different heights depending on how heavily laden they are and how dense the water is. So if you see one floating higher than another, now you know why.](https://thefactbase.com/ships-float-at-different-heights-depending-on-how-heavily-laden-they-are-and-how-dense-the-water-is-so-if-you-see-one-floating-higher-than-another-now-you-know-why)

- [The amount of water on Earth is constant, meaning that, like energy, it is constantly being used, filtered, and recycled.](https://thefactbase.com/the-amount-of-water-on-earth-is-constant-meaning-that-like-energy-it-is-constantly-being-used-filtered-and-recycled)
- [Frequent consumption of coffee leads to a decrease in breast size. 3 cups of coffee a day can cause your breasts to become smaller especially if they were big in the first place. This is because caffeine burns fat.](https://thefactbase.com/frequent-consumption-of-coffee-leads-to-a-decrease-in-breast-size-3-cups-of-coffee-a-day-can-cause-your-breasts-to-become-smaller-especially-if-they-were-big-in-the-first-place-this-is-because-caffeine-burns-fat)

This is called the Triple Boil, and at that temperature, water exists as a gas, a liquid, and a solid simultaneously.](https://thefactbase.com/water-can-exist-in-three-states-at-once-this-is-called-the-triple-boil-and-at-that-temperature-water-exists-as-a-gas-a-liquid-and-a-solid-simultaneously)
- [Humans accidentally created a protective bubble around Earth. Decades of use of very low frequency (VLF) radio communications have resulted in an artificial cocoon that could help protect the planet from solar flares and radiation particles.](https://thefactbase.com/humans-accidentally-created-a-protective-bubble-around-earth-decades-of-use-of-very-low-frequency-vlf-radio-communications-have-resulted-in-an-artificial-cocoon-that-could-help-protect-the-planet-from-solar-flares-and-radiation-particles)
